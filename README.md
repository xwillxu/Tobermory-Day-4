# Tobermory-Day-4
Today, we went emmett lake it was a amazing time there we caught 1 fish, then a 4-5 pound bass broke the line and we could not fish anymore, But the good thing is that we were able to get 1 bass(2 pounds). Later we went back home cooked the fish.

Around 5-9pm we went to Cyprus Lake, then we went hiking for a little bit.
